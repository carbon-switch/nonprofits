# Non-profit revenue script
In December 2021 I published this report on non-profit giving - https://carbonswitch.co/analysis-of-environmental-giving 

This is the script that I used to gather most of the data. 

Apologies for any sloppy or confusing code. I didn't write it for public use. But hope it helps anyone doing research on this topic. 

Feel free to make changes and improve it!

You can email me any questions at michael (at) carbonswitch (dot) co
